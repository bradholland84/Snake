# Snake
This classic game of Snake demonstrates the use of [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/), a WebGL/Canvas rendering engine designed for speed.

A web developer would want to use this technology if they are building a 2D game for the web.
The best thing about Pixi.js is its Renderer auto-detect: If webGL is not supported, it will automatically
fall back to Canvas rendering so you only have to code things once.

Pixi is open source with a flourishing developer community that continually improves the engine.

##Playing the game
